This script in profile pages in Instagram.  
It adds a static element in the upper right corner of the page,  
showing how many images out of total are visible (and also as a percentage) (see screenshot in the end).  
Also, if you scroll down, beyond the first 12 images,  
then the "LOAD MORE" button(to show more images) will be automatically clicked (so, it's bypassed).  

The instagram site uses single-page application workflow (i.e. the history API).  
Since v2016.08.02 it's no no longer needed to open a profile page in a new tab *(now using the excellent library [arrive.js](https://github.com/uzairfarooq/arrive)).  

Thanks a lot to wOxxOm for his valuable help in [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/forum/discussion/4642/help-with-making-a-hovering-element-that-scrolls-with-you-with-attaching-to-infinite-scrolling-event).
