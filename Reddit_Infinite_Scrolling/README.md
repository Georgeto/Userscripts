This script adds infinite scrolling to subreddits and to comments.
To Subreddits it does this while omitting the nav buttons as new page content is loaded.
It also works for comments (in pages with a lot of comments, for example [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3h70d5/a_trail_of_evidence_leading_to_atts_partnership/)).

It uses [jScroll](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/11636-jscroll) (a jQuery plugin)

Thanks a lot to jScroll's developer, Philip Klauzinski, 
for essentially making this script himself, ([the initial version](https://github.com/pklauzinski/jscroll/issues/58), i.e. for subreddits only), 
as well as wOxxOm for his help [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/forum/discussion/comment/16349#Comment_16349).
