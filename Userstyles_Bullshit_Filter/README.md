Hides styles for popular browser games and social networks, styles that use "foreign" characters in descriptions as well as styles that have no screenshots, when browsing or searching styles.  
i.e. it filters any/all of these 5 categories:  
* **Games**: styles for browser games like Kingdoms of Camelot, Mafia Wars and Ikariam  
* **Social Networks**: styles for general purpose social networking sites like Facebook, studiVZ and VKontakte  
* **Non-ASCII**: styles that use non-English characters in description (accents, umlauts, cyrillic letters, ...)  
* **Clutter**: obvious spam, titles like "asdasdasd", description = title, title < 6 characters, "just a test".  
* **No screenshot**: styles that have no screenshots.  

The filters list appears just below the `#sidebar-forum` element (i.e. on the left).

*<u>Note</u>: you may uncomment line 42 (and comment out line 43), in order the filtered styles to be highlighted khaki -instead of hiding them- so that you can check which styles have been filtered.*
