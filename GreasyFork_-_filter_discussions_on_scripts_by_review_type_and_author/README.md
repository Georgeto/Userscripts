This script applies in discussions list on scripts (yours and of others).  

It adds 3 element sets:
- filter buttons (one to filter the discussions based on type (`Question`, `Bad`, `Ok`, `Good`) ),    
- a hoverable dropdown menu to filter the discussions based on author,
- an autocomplete 

The author's list is sorted based on the usernames as they appear on the page,  
If you want to have it sorted alphabetially you may uncomment line 36 of the script.


It's partially based on this script: [userscripts.org Bullshit Filter](http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/97145) (by kuehlschrank). 
Thanks a lot to kuehlschrank for making another great script.
