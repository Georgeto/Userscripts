This script applies in discussions list on scripts (yours and of others).  

It adds two button sets:
- one to filter the discussions based on type (`Question`, `Bad`, `Ok`, `Good`), and  
- one to filter the discussions based on author. 

The author's list is sorted based on the usernames as they appear on the page,  
If you want to have it sorted alphabetially you may uncomment line 30 of the script.


It's partially based on this script: [userscripts.org Bullshit Filter](http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/97145) (by kuehlschrank). 
Thanks a lot to kuehlschrank for making another great script.
