This script applies in discussions list on scripts (yours and of others).  

It adds 3 element sets:
- filter buttons (one to filter the discussions based on type (`Question`, `Bad`, `Ok`, `Good`) ),    
- a hoverable dropdown menu, and
- an autocomplete searchbox
 to filter the discussions based on author.

The author's list in the hoverable dropdown menu is sorted based on the usernames as they appear on the page. 

It's partially based on this script: [userscripts.org Bullshit Filter](http://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/97145) (by kuehlschrank). 
Thanks a lot to kuehlschrank for making another great script.

It also works with [[TS] Citrus GFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/4336-ts-citrus-gfork).
Î¤hanks to decembre for contributing the needed changes.
