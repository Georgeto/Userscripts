This script applies in profile view (yours and of others).  
It's meant for those who have also uploaded libraries (i.e. not only scripts):  
By default it shows only the scripts - optionally you may display only the libraries or both.

It adds these 3 links/buttons on top right:  (here, to [my profile](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/2160-darkred))
