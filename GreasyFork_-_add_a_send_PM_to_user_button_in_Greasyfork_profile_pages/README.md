By default you may send a pm via a user's forum profile page (e.g. see link 1).  
With this script you may also send a pm via user's Greasyfork profile page (e.g. see link 2).

*Notes: the button doesn't appear in your own Greasyfork profile page,  
and it only works when you are logged in, for obvious reasons*.
