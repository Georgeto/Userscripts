Adds a column with torrent and magnet links in RARBG lists.

Note: the script generates the magnet links based on the filenames of the thumbnail images   
that appear when you mouseover on a torrent entry (because these filenames are the same as the relevant torrent hash)  
But for some torrents the filename is generic (and not the same as the hash).  
therefore the magnet link cannot be generated.  
Also, in the Catalog section of the site there are not thumbnails,   
therefore the magnet link there cannot be generated either.
