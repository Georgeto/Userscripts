Adds a column with torrent and magnet links in RARBG lists:  
![](https://i.imgur.com/qmxoJyi.jpg)

Notes: 

- the script generates the magnet links based on the filenames of the thumbnail images 
that appear when you mouseover on a torrent title  
(because these filenames are the same as the relevant torrent hash).  
But for some torrents the thumbnail filename is generic (and not equal to the torrent hash) 
therefore the magnet link cannot be generated.  
- Also, in the Catalog section of the site there are not thumbnails, therefore the magnet link there cannot be generated either.
