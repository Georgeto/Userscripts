This script adds unread notifications count in the tab title in Twitter.  
eg. (in timeline) instead of  
`(1) Twitter`, it becomes  
`3 | (1) Twitter` 
where 3 is the unread notifications count and (1) the default unread tweets count.  

Since v3 using the excellent library [arrive.js](https://github.com/uzairfarooq/arrive)  

Thanks a lot to wOxxOm for his valuable help in [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/forum/discussion/3765/twitter-to-include-the-unread-notifications-count-in-the-tab-title).
